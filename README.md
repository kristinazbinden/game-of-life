# Game of Life
## Program written in Java using loops, arrays and methods to track data as it changes with each iteration. The changing data is presented visually as a row of blocks on the screen using acm.graphics. Each block represents a house, all built in a circle, and the color of the block changes depending on whether the villager inside is alive or dead.

The rules for the algorithm are as folllows:

* If the current villager is alive, and only one neighbor is alive, the current villager is dead in the next generation.
* If the current villager is alive, and both neighbors are alive or both dead, the current villager is alive in the next generation.
* If the current villager is dead, and only one neighbor is alive, the current villager is alive in the next generation.
* If the current villager is dead, and both neighbors are alive or both dead, the current villager is dead in the next generation.

## This is based on Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton game originated by Cambridge mathmetician John Conway. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
